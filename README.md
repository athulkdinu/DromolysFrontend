# Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload a CSV file, view the data in a table, select a column, compute statistics, and visualize numeric data using a histogram.

All CSV parsing, statistics computation, and histogram data generation are handled on the **backend**, while the frontend consumes the APIs and renders the results.
